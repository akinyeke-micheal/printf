Custom printf Replication in C
This repository contains a custom implementation of the printf function in C, designed to mimic the behavior and format specifiers of the standard C library's printf function. This project aims to provide a detailed and highly customizable printf function for developers seeking an alternative or deeper understanding of the inner workings of this fundamental C function.

Introduction
The printf function is a crucial part of C programming, used for formatted output. This repository provides a custom implementation of printf that closely replicates the standard printf function. By exploring this project, you can gain a deeper understanding of how printf works and customize it to suit your specific needs.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you can use this custom printf, ensure that you have:

A C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.
A basic understanding of C programming and the standard printf function.
Compilation
To compile the code, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/printf-replica.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd printf-replica
Compile the code using your preferred C compiler (e.g., GCC):

bash
Copy code
gcc -o printf_replica main.c printf_replica.c
Run the executable:

bash
Copy code
./printf_replica
Usage
Format Specifiers
The custom printf supports the following format specifiers:

%d - Integer
%f - Float
%s - String
%c - Character
Examples
Here are some basic examples of using the custom printf:

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 42;
    float pi = 3.14159265359;
    char name[] = "John Doe";

    printf_replica("Integer: %d\n", num);
    printf_replica("Float: %f\n", pi);
    printf_replica("String: %s\n", name);

    return 0;
}
Advanced Features
Custom Format Specifiers
You can extend the custom printf by adding your own format specifiers. To do this, modify the printf_replica.c file and define the behavior for your custom specifier.

Buffer Size Configuration
The default buffer size for printf_replica is set to 256 bytes. You can configure this buffer size in the printf_replica.h header file to suit your memory requirements.
